# Bomberman
This repository is for the game we created for Cognition'17 based on the classic bomberman.

### How do I get set up?
* Get yourself a copy of Unreal Engine 4.16.3 (other versions will have import issues)
* Make sure that you have the AnimStarterPack and StarterContent in your Content directory
* Fetch this content and compile the game and it should start running.

**Important note:
This repo was not initialised properly, i.e. not all the configuration content is in place. You will be required to set up keyboard controls, for the game.
Also the build version of the game is ahead of the commits. I guess some commits were lost during transition!**

### About Cognition
Cognition is the annual technical festival organised at the SIES Graduate School of Technology. As one of the premier technical festivals in the city of Navi Mumbai, Cognition defines what it means to be a holistic collegiate festival - an amalgamation of stellar technical prowess and a creative ethos designed to entertain and enthral the wide range of audiences that attend this festival each year.

### Cognition'17
In the Era before discrete GPUs and teraflops of performance was a time of gaming simplicity. Electronics and Mechanics went hand in hand to produce a gaming environment that amused an entire generation and beyond. This ‘Age of the Arcade’ also laid the foundation for the modern gaming community that has gone from spanning a neighbourhood competing for high scores at the local arcade to a worldwide family of gamers. 

To celebrate this golden age of gaming and the confluence of technologies, this year Cognition is themed after ‘Arcade’ - an homage to those games that defined our childhood, implemented with today’s tools and resources. Having made a flight into Space in 2015, and a venture into the Virtual World in 2016, experience the pleasures of Time Travel at Cognition 2017 as we revisit Arcade, games from days gone by.
